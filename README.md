#### **Unsolved Problems**

Dealer doesn't automate decisions. 

I didn't add the option for Aces to be 1 or 11 yet.

Have not cleaned up the code because I had an issue with the card images. 

When you hit a blackjack/bust, that card image does not show up in your hand visually. It just resets hands and updates the score. A set timeout would work to fix it. Changing the order the functions are called could be a solution also.
 
#### **Major Hurdles**


Getting the deckofcardsAPI to work for me. Ultimately, I took their object of a deck of cards and pasted in my own javascript to use. 

Having the images show up correctly gave me more issues then anything else. I wouldn't say that's because it was inherently more difficult. The way I was trying to go about it was the problem. I would of had to re write a large portion of code to fix that. Eventually I got that working but it took time away that I could of added more features/fixed bugs.
