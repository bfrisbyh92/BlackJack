# BlackJack

A simple game of BlackJack. Player and Dealer for the first hand are dealt two cards each. You can then draw a card or "stay". The goal is to have the sum of your hand be greater than the dealers sum without going above 21.

#### **Unsolved Problems**

Dealer doesn't automate decisions. 

I didn't add the option for Aces to be 1 or 11 yet.
#### **Major Hurdles**

Getting the deckofcardsAPI to work for me. Ultimately, I took their object of a deck of cards and pasted in my own javascript to use.
